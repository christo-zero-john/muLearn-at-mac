                <p class="">What to do after joining discord server?</p>

                <p class="">
                    The First thing to do after joining the discord server is to <span class="mark"> introduce yourself to the community </span> (refer to <a href="/p/joinus.html#step5" class="text-decoration-none">step 5 </a> of join us page). After that familiarise yourself with our discord server enviornment. 
                </p>

                <p class="">μlearn Discord Server</p>

                <p class="">
                    Mulearn works inside discord. Discord is a platform used by numerous communities (especially
                    gaming communities) to hang out and work
                    together. Every community in discord is called a
                    <span class="mark">server</span>.
                    Mulearn also has a discord server of its own. mulearn uses <span class="mark">gamification</span> as a tool that makes learning fun and engaging. Students gets <span class="mark"> Karma Points</span> (Points in mulearn are called as karma points . Just like experience points/exp in games.) for completing tasks or achieving certain accomplishments. Karma points are a proof of the work students do because these are earned by cracking tasks designed by the best  mentors out there. Karma points are worth their weight in gold and can be used to obtain a variety of benefits, including invitations to exclusive and paid events, promotions in our   community etc... There are certain internships that students having karma points above a certain limit could only apply for. 
                </p>
                    <p class="">The Gamification</p>

                    <p class="">
                        Students engage in the community mainly by doing tasks. <strong class="">Every task has certain karma points assosciated with it.</strong> Just after you join the community you get access to 3 channels, which are: <code>lvl-1-info</code>, <code>lvl-2-info</code> & <code>lvl-3-info</code>. These channels conatins certain tasks ehich are related to certain general skills that everyone should have. Hence these tasks are called <span class="mark">General Enablement Tasks</span>. Every tasks has a unique <span class="mark">hashtag</span> (a code word that starts with #)assosciated with it. The hashtags of General Enablement Tasks starts with <span class="fw-700">#ge-</span>. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="">The level System</p> 
                    
                    <p class="">
                        mulearn also has a well defined <span class="mark">level system</span>. Every member in mulearn has their own level. When you join the discord server your will be <strong class="">level 1</strong>. To become a level 2 member you must introduce yourself to the community (You can find this as a task in lvl-1-info channel.). There are several <span class="mark">modertors</span> who reviews your task and gives you karma points. Once you get karma points for self-introduction, you will advance to <strong class="">Level 2</strong>. To become a level 3 member you need to get atleast 400 karma points from level 2 tasks. All Tasks in lvl-2-info channel are level 2 tasks. Once you get 400 karma points from level 2 tasks, you'll advance to <strong class="">Level 3</strong>

                        To become a level 4 member you need to get atleast 800 karma points from level 3 tasks. All Tasks in lvl-3-info channel are level 3 tasks. Once you get 800 karma points from level 3 tasks, you'll advance to <strong class="">Level 4</strong>. The interesting fact is that <strong class="">There is no need for you to do tasks in any order. You can choose any task from any channel in a random order, and then complete and submit it to get corresponding karma points.</strong> That is you can do level 3 tasks even before becoming a level 3 member (That is wehn you are lvl 1 or lvl 2 member) and also you can do level 2 tasks even after becoming a level 3 member and can do level 3 tasks even after becoming a level 4 member.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="">Level 4 is an important <span class="mark">checkpoint</span>, because once you become a level 4 member, you gets access to <span class="mark">Interest Groups.</span> 
                    </p>

                    <p class="">The Interest Groups</p>

                    <p class="">
                        What exactly is an interest group? An interest group simply is a group related to certain career field like web development, cyber security, AI, IoT, etc... Students interested in these fields can choose these Interest groups and gets trained in that respective field. Currently in mulearn we have more than 11 Interest Groups. (You can see it all <a href="https://mulearn.org/journey" class="text-decoration-none">here</a> ). <strong class="">Only Level 4 members can Join Interest Groups.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p class="">How To Join an Interest Group?</p>

                    <p class="">After becoming a Level 4 member you can join any Interest Group as you like. For that:</p>
                    <p class=""> Goto <a href="https://app.mulearn.org" class="text-decoration-none">app.mulearn.org</a>. In the basic details section you can find a section named <strong class="">Interest Groups </strong> with an edit option. Click on that and select Your Interest Group. <strong class="">You can select upto 3 interest groups and also you can change interest groups anytime you wish.</strong> 
                    </p>

                    <p class="">
                        Once you select your Interest Group you can see a section with the same name as your interest group in the discord server. (Eg: For web development it is <code>WEB DEVELOPMENT</code> ).
                    </p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/muGuide/1.png" alt="" class="py-2 cImg d-block mx-auto">
                    
                    <p class="">
                        Similarly there will be sections for all the interest groups you've selected.<br>
                        In each section there are certain channels.

                        <br><br>

                        1. Channel with the same name as the interest group and ends with info

                        3. Channel with same name as the interest group and with the icon of #. 
                        <img src="/assets/img/muGuide/4.png" alt="" class="py-2 cImg d-block mx-auto">

                        <img src="/assets/img/muGuide/5.png" alt="" class="py-2 cImg d-block mx-auto">

                        In Week days (Mon-Fri) every interest group will have a weekly meting. In this meeting/gathering anyone can join and ask their doubts/help others clarify their doubts and even discuss about their ongoing/upcoming projects with others. Those meetings are held in this channel. It is a regular meeting and every interest group has a fixed day and time. For web development it is Thursday 7:30 PM. This meeting is named as <span class="mark">Office Hour</span>.

                        <br><br>

                        5. Other channels. <br>
                        There are some other random channels for different interest group (For example here #exercism in web development). These channels are for task submission related to certain events (past or ongoing events).
                    </p>
                    

                    <p class="">
                        This is basically how <strong class="">#cl-exercism-javascript-140</strong> are organized. Once you become a Level 4 member you can choose your Interest Group and start doing tasks. You can choose upto 3 Interest Groups at a time and can change Interest Groups anytime. To become a level 5 member you need to earn atleast 1600 karma points from level 4 tasks. You can Find level 4 tasks in lvl-4-info channel of all Interest Groups. (You can choose Level 4 tasks from any Interest Group and only needs a total of 1600 Karma points from Level 4 tasks. For Example you can earn 900 points from level 4 tasks of web development, 300 points from level 4 tasks of IoT, 400 points from level 4 tasks of Cyber Security to make a total of 1600 points. That is only the quantity matters, you can earn from level 4 task of any Interest Groups. ) Once you get 1600 Karma Points from Level 4 tasks you will become a <strong>level 5</strong> member.
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="">

                    </p>

                        <strong>Level 7</strong> is the maximum level as of now. More levels will be added  eventually. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="">
                        That's basically everything about the Discord Level System.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="">How to find do Tasks?</p>

                    <p class="">
                        Once you Join the discord server you can start doing tasks. The first task everyone should complete is the <span class="mark">Self Introduction</span> task.
